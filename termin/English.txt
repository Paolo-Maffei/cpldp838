termin v2.1 CPLDP-8 terminal software manual by omiokone

termin is terminal software for operating CPLDP-8 from a serially connected Windows PC.

1. Installation
  Put termin.exe in a suitable folder.
  Create a shortcut for termin.exe.
  Right-click on the shortcut to open its properties.
  The link destination of the shortcut tab should be as follows, for example.
    "C: \ Program Files \ termin \ termin.exe"
  Add 3 arguments here as in the example below.
    "COM1: baud = 19200 data = 8 parity = N stop = 1" "c: \ pdp8" "35"
  The first argument is the port specification, and COM1 is the port name to which CPLDP-8 is connected.
  The second argument is the default folder name in the file open dialog, which you transfer to CPLDP-8.
  Specify the name of the actual folder where the file is placed.
  The third argument is the character time interval (msec) when sending a text file.

2. Uninstall
  Delete termin.exe. I'm not using the registry.

3. Startup and operation
  Start from the shortcut created in 1.
  
  menu
  Exit Exit.
  Send
    Send the raw file as it is.
    Send without trailer (last 80H sequence) of Binary File file.
    Set the MSB of each character in the Text File file to 1 and send it with the specified spacing between the characters.
                 Do not send Line Feed.
    Forcibly terminates transmission on End.
  Receive
    Receive raw file as it is.
    Text File The MSB of each character is masked and saved as 0.
    File reception on End is performed until it ends at End.
  Clear screen clear

  [Ctrl] + [@] (00) [Ctrl] + [^] (1E) [Ctrl] + [_] (1F) cannot be used together with the [Ctrl] key.
  If the [Send] or [Recieve] item is disabled, the previous file remains open.
  Since it is, close it with [End].

4. Windows CE version
  From the WinCE folder, rename the one that matches the CPU of your model to termin.exe and use it.
  Unlike the Windows version, the first argument is only the port specification such as "COM1:", and the baud rate etc. is specified.
  But it is ignored.

5. Change font
  You can change the default Courier New, which can be used on old Windows, to other monospaced fonts.
  Specify the 4th argument "Consolas" etc. for the shortcut.
  Get Teleprinter Bold (TELE_B.TTF) by Mark Zanzig and put it in \ WINDOWS \ Fonts
  You can make it teletype by specifying "Teleprinter Bold".

6. Character transfer problem
  An error occurs when sending the text of the program to the paper tape version of FOCAL or BASIC. this
  Are for low-speed teletypes, and hard flow because they take in unlimited buffers with interrupts.
  Control is useless. It was solved by slowing down the transfer speed.
  It is ideal to specify the character spacing and line end time like TeraTerm, but the optimum time depends on the software.
  Since it is different and complicated, only the character spacing is used.

7. Compile
  When compiling with Visual Stdio
  Project Properties> Configuration Properties> General> Character Set> None
  Project Properties> Configuration Properties> C / C ++> Code Generation>
  Runtime Library> Multithreaded (/ MT)
  Specified as.

8. Development history
  The following functions are required for the terminal software for PDP-8.
  Most software inputs and outputs characters with 7-bit mark parity. On the other hand, binary is 8-bit transfer.
  b. Transfer binary files raw (without using Xmodem etc.).
  c. Setting the character transfer rate described in 6.
  d. In CPLDP-8, cut 80H at the end of the binary with 4K FORTRAN.
  e. CPLDP-8 checks CTS every 1 byte for 19200 baud transfer without buffer.
     There is a need.
  Since there is no software that satisfies all of these, we developed it by diverting our own old code.
  I did not use overlapped I / O to share it with the Windows CE version, but for use on recent PCs
  Since it is impossible, it was completely rewritten in v2.1.
