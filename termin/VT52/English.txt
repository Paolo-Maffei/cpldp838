termin VT52 v2.2 CPLDP-8 terminal software manual by omiokone

This version adds an ESC sequence to make termin compatible with VT52 terminals.
However, it is limited to the function to run the VISTA editor.
The usage is the same as the regular version.

As with the VT52, you cannot see the screen before scrolling, so make the following settings on OS / 8.
.SET TTY WIDTH 80
.SET TTY HEIGHT 24
.SET TTY PAGE
.SET TTY PAUSE 60
.SET TTY SCOPE
As a result, when one screen is exceeded by DIR etc., it is paused, and it is stopped by [Ctrl] + [S] and [Ctrl] + [Q].
You can resume. However, it is valid only for software that uses the OS / 8 device handler.
This setting can be reused by saving the disc.
Even if these are not set, it does not affect the operation of VISTA.
