CPLDP-8 OS / 8 Manual

Note
Since OS / 8 does not allow key advance input, it does not operate until the prompt is displayed.
Command input is always uppercase. It does not recognize lowercase letters and returns ?.

1. How to boot OS / 8
Put diskload.ris and os8a.rf in the default folder of termin
Start termin. Reset CPLDP-8
Send diskload.ris with [Send]-[Raw file]
Send os8a.rf with [Send]-[Raw file]
Stop in about 4 minutes Reset CPLDP-8 Press spacebar
When. Is displayed, wait for OS command input.
[Del] to cancel one character of input. Cancel one line with [Ctrl] + [U].

To save the disc after work
Reset CPLDP-8 while waiting for a command
Specify the save file name with [Receive]-[Raw File]
Send disksave.ris with [Send]-[Raw file]
After stopping
Close the output file with [Receive]-[End]

Reference: The boot ROM executes the RIM loader when the first byte is 80H or the next bit of MSB is 1, and it
Other than that, OS / 8 is started. At OS / 8, this 1 byte is discarded.

2. Frequently used commands
DIR (DIRECTORY) Display file list (by name in DIR / A)
Delete DEL (DELETE) file
REN (RENAME) Rename file REN New name <Old name
Copy of COPY file COPY Copy destination <Copy source
TY (TYPE) Text file printing
*? Wildcards can be used.
The device name of the disk cannot be SYS: or RF :.
A continuous area is required to write a file. Collect free space if necessary.
.SQUISH SYS:
Enter Y in ARE YOU SURE ?.

AA-H608-TA OS / 8 TECO REFERENCE MANUAL
AA-H609-TA OS / 8 LANGUAGE REFERENCE MANUAL
DEC-S8-OSHBA-A-D OS / 8 handbook 1974 is an exhaustive but older version.

3. How to create a text file
Since EDIT takes time and effort, it is a method to pour in what you edited on your PC.
.R PIP
* TEST.TX <TTY: / A (Create TEST.TX / A is an ASCII mode option)
When waiting for input, send the file prepared by [Send]-[Text] of termin
After transfer, press [Ctrl] + [Z] to exit *, then press [ESC] to exit.

4. SIMH
You can add software to os8a.rf on your PC using the PDP-8 simulator SIMH and os8pack.
Changed os8.txt to below
SET DF DISABLE
SET RF ENABLE 1P
ATT RF os8a.rf
ATT RK0 os8.rk05
BOOT RK0
The device name for os8a.rf is RF:
After work, update os8a.rf by the following operation
[Ctrl] + [E] (Return to SIMH)
DET RF (write image file)

To apply SQUISH RF: to os8a.rf with SIMH, change the PIP.SV of SYS: to the one for capacity 224K in os8a.rf.
Need to be replaced.

5. How to run paper tape software on OS / 8
Add below to os8.txt in the above SIMH environment
ATT PTR XXX (XXX is the binary file to read)
.R PIP
* RF: XXX.BN <PTR: / B
Exit with Ctlr-Z [ESC] when ^ is displayed
On OS / 8 of CPLDP-8
.R ABSLDR
* XXX.BN = 002.0 / G (00200 is the starting address that differs depending on the software)
ABSLDR checks checksum, so the binary file needs to be the original, not for CPLDP-8.
Immediately after without / G to make XXX.SV executable with R command
.SAVE RF XXX

OS / 8 CPLDP-8 version technical explanation

PDP-8 has a maximum memory of 4Kword x 8 = 32Kword due to 3bit field, but CPLDP-8 has an additional 3bit
It has 32Kword x 8 = 256Kword in the extra field. extra field 111 is normal PDP-8 memory
000-110 is the RAM disk.

For the inside of OS / 8, refer to OS / 8 software support manual DEC-S8-OSSMB-A-D.

Boot with a real RF08 disk.
Manual input (or ROM) loader in memory memorizes the first 128 words of block 0 of the disk
Transfer to 06604 ~ and execute from 06622.
Transferred 06653 to 07003 to 17647 to 17777 (field 1 resident portion).
Transfer the latter 128 words (field 0 resident portion) of block 0 to memory 07600 ~ (07750)
Note that the value is initially rewritten to 07750 in the middle of 0 transfer) 07605 (OS / 8 destructive entry)
Run from.

CPLDP-8 is deployed directly in memory with boot ROM. The arrangement in block0 is the same as the real thing.
block0 000 ` 177 ¨ memory 17600 ` 17777 (actual resident part is 17647 ` 17777)
       200-377 ¨ 07600-07777
The system device handler from 07607 has been rewritten.

Execution of 07605 transfers blocks 007 to 012 keyb'd monitor to 00000 and executes from 04000.
Read blocks 013 to 015 user service routine with keyb'd monitor.

os8a.rf creates RF08 disk image (256Kword) with SIMH and 224Kword directory
Fixed to. PIP and RESORC have their own device information and need a patch. These are the above mani
