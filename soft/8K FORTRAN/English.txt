2. Source error check (optional)
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send ft8err.ssb (error checker) with [Send]-[Raw File].
When PDP-8 FORTRAN DEC-08-A2B1-4 is displayed.
Send test.txt (source) with [Send]-[Text File].
If there is a mistake, the location and contents will be displayed (otherwise nothing will be displayed).

3. Compile
Reset CPLDP-8.
Specify test.sab (compiled output) in [Receive]-[Text File].
Send ft8cmpl.ssb (compiler) with [Send]-[Raw File].
Send test.txt (source) with [Send]-[Text File].
After stopping.
Click [Receive]-[End] to close the output file.

4. Assemble
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send sabr.ssb (assembler) with [Send]-[Raw File].
Answer N twice to the question.
Specify test.bin (assemble output) in [Receive]-[Raw File].
Send test.sab (compiled output) with [Send]-[Text File] (path 1).
Looks like you haven't done anything for quite some time. After stopping.
Send test.sab with [Send]-[Text File] (path 2).
Press the CONTINUE switch.
After stopping.
Click [Send]-[End] to close the input file.
Click [Receive]-[End] to close the output file.

5. Run
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send lload.ssb (loader) with [Send]-[Raw File].
When PDP-8 LINKING LOADER DEC-08-A2C3-07 is displayed.
Send test.bin (assembled output) with [Send]-[Raw File].
After stopping.
Click [Send]-[End] to close the input file.
At this point, exit termin and restart it.
Press the CONTINUE switch.
Send lib1 (library) with [Send]-[Raw File].
Enter 2000S when it is in the standby state with * displayed. In the display
MAIN 10212
Is the starting address.
* Executed by inputting 10212J for the display.

6. Explanation
The part that requires switch input of the loader was modified to terminal input.
XXXXS (XXXX is an octal number up to 4 digits) can be continued with the switch set to XXXX
0S-7S is a load to field 0-7 (only S is the same as 0S).
2000S is a map display.
See the manual for the meaning of the values. Since it was modified exclusively for teletype input, bits 6 and 7 must be set to 1.
No need.
XXXXXJ (XXXXX is an octal number up to 5 digits) starts execution from XXXXX.

The lib1 lib2 library was modified to be loaded by sending the above S command by myself.
lib1 is loaded in field 0 and lib2 is loaded in field 7.
You also need to load lib2 to use real functions like SIN.

Since the loader does not read the binary to the end, quit termin once and clean the serial garbage
Exclude. When using USB-serial conversion, PurgeComm () could not remove it.
Since there is no other use than here, termin does not have a connection disconnection function.
