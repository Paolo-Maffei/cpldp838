[Del] (code 7F teletype [RUBOUT] key) to erase one character during input. Canceling the entire line
[_] (Code 5F teletype [Å©] key).
Since it is basically only uppercase letters, Caps Lock the keyboard.
Variable names only recognize the first two characters. For example, A11 and A12 represent the same variable.

            DEC-08-AJ1E-PB 4 words, 8K overlay

It is a mechanism that can increase the user area without using mathematical functions, but it is troublesome to start.
Omitted.
DEC-08-AJ1E-PB is an overlay that improves real number accuracy in the first half and uses 8K memory in the second half.
