Binary Loader
Executable: binload.ris
how to use
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send binload.ris with [Send]-[Raw File].
Send the binary file you want to read with [Send]-[Raw File].

See DEC-08-LBAA-D for the binary file format.
Below is an example of a binary file converted from paper tape (hexadecimal), but there are changes to use with CPLDP-8.
necessary.
  00 80 80 80 42 00 ... 10 03 3B 3A 80 80 80 00 00 00
00 of the blank part of the first tape is harmful, and the leader part of 80 is unnecessary, so remove it.
The trailer part after 80 at the end is removed leaving only one so that it will not be sent to the software to be executed.
Execution starts from the last specified field and origin (address), so for example field 0
Added 48 00 for C0 and address 1000 (octal).
The 2 bytes just before the trailer are checksum, but the value is ignored, so leave it as it is.
Examples of making these changes
  42 00 ... 10 03 C0 48 00 3B 3A 80

If you prepare a loader and a binary file in one, [Send]-[Raw File]
You can start the binary in one go.

This software converted DEC-08-LBAA-PM to self start format, and made the following changes.
address (octal)
7677 TAD Å® JMP 7756
7707 SMA, CLA Å® CLA Input fixed to teletype
7710 TAD Å® NOP
Additional automatic start section
7756 CLA IAC field Create CIF from CDF instruction for change
7757 TAD MEMTEM
7760 DCA .+ 1
7761 (CIF) Run CIF written in DCA
7762 JMP I ORIGIN

Conversion from DEC binary to RIS format for RIM or CPLDP-8
Executable: bin2ris.exe
how to use
On the MS-DOS / Windows command line
RIM format
  bin2ris <input binary file> output file
RIS format
  bin2ris <input binary file> output file -s start address (octal)
The execution start address is added with the -s option, and it can be booted with the CPLDP-8 boot loader.

PAL-8 compatible cross assembler
Executable: pal.exe
how to use
On the MS-DOS / Windows command line
Binary format output
  pal source file
RIM format output
  pal source file -r

Building for DOS with some modifications to the sources of Douglas Jones, Rich Coon, Bernhard Baehr and others
What was done.

Disassembler
Executable file: disasm8.exe
how to use
On the MS-DOS / Windows command line
  disasm8 <input binary file> output file

It was made up in about an hour for analysis of software that needs correction with CPLDP-8, and then the hand
In addition, the degree of perfection is low.
