How to use 4K ALGOL (ALGOL-8) with CPLDP-8 and termin

1. Manual
4K ALGOL (DEC-08-KAYA-D)

2. Compilation procedure
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send alg8cmpl.ssb (compiler) with [Send]-[Raw File].
Enter T in the OPT- display and select teletype I / O.
Specify test.bin (compiled output) in [Receive]-[Raw File].
Send test.txt (source) with [Send]-[Text File].
Stop at the end of compilation.
Click [Receive]-[End] to close the output file.

3. Execution procedure (when not using functions such as SIN)
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send binload.ris (binary loader) with [Send]-[Raw File].
(binload.ris is in \ soft \ utility)
Send test.bin (compiled output) with [Send]-[Binary File].
Executed by sending alg8os3.bin (ALGOL OS) with [Send]-[Raw File].

4. Execution procedure (when using a function)
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send binload.ris (binary loader) with [Send]-[Raw File].
Send test.bin (compiled output) with [Send]-[Binary File].
Send alg8os4.bin (ALGOL OS) with [Send]-[Raw File].
After stopping, close alg8os4.bin with [Send]-[End].
At this point, exit termin and restart it.
Press the CONTINUE switch.
Executed by sending alg8os5.bin (ALGOL OVERLAY) with [Send]-[Raw File].
(Note) Exit termin once to eliminate serial dust. When using USB-serial conversion
    It could not be removed by PurgeComm ().

5. Diagnosis when compiling is not possible
If you display the compile output file on the screen without specifying it in step 2, if there is an error, it will be on the last line.
An error code is displayed. See Chapter 7 of the manual for the meaning.
(Note: There is no error code in the attached test.txt)

6. Reference
The compiler is in self start format for CPLDP-8. ALGOL OS boots from binary loader
Therefore, in addition to adding the start address, the following changes have been made.

alg8cmpl.ssb
Original binary: DEC-08-KA1A-PB
alg8os3.bin
Original binary: DEC-08-KA3A-PB
alg8os5.bin
Original binary: DEC-08-KA5A-PB

alg8os4.bin
Original binary: DEC-08-KA4A-PB
