Usage of PALIII assembler with CPLDP-8 and termin

1. Manual
PAL III SYMBOLIC ASSEMBLER PDP-8 PROGRAMMING MANUAL (DEC-08-ASAC-D)

2. Assembling procedure
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send pal3.ssb (assembler) with [Send]-[Raw File].
Send test.txt (source) with [Send]-[Text File] (path 1).
If you stop. Press the CONTINUE switch,
Specify test.bin (assemble output) in [Receive]-[Raw File].
Send test.txt with [Send]-[Text File] (path 2).
If you stop.
Click [Receive]-[End] to close the output file.
The following can be omitted.
Press the CONTINUE switch,
Send test.txt with [Send]-[Text File] (path 3).
The source list is output.

3. Execution procedure
Reset CPLDP-8.
Send binload.ris (binary loader) with [Send]-[Raw File].
(binload.ris is in \ soft \ utility)
Send test.bin (assembled output binary) with [Send]-[Raw File] to start execution.

4. Other
The source file can be created with a text editor. Giving start information to the assemble output
Therefore, write the start field and start address at the end like test.txt. binload

5. Reference
The assembler has a self start format for CPLDP-8, and the following changes have been made.
Original binary: DEC-08-ASC1-PB
The path is specified by the switch, but path 1 to path 3 are automatically executed.
0217 TAD 0053 Å® 0000 / Non-execution code Used to store the pass number

0226 CLA OSR Å® CLA CLL CML RTR / 2000 Å® AC
0227 AND 0124 Å® TAD 0217 / Corresponds to the next PASS to be executed
0230 SNA Å® DCA 0217 / Create switch register value
0231 JMP 0240 Å® TAD 0217

Binary output The number of trailing 80 (hexadecimal) is changed from 32 to 1, eliminating unnecessary input at the start of binary execution.
1274 7740 Å® 7777
